Introduction:
This project aims to Analyse the maize supply chain to predict potential food shortages and understand price volatility in South Africa. 
By employing linear regression, the aim is to : 
                                                - forecast future supply and demand patterns for maize.
                                                - identify and Analyse critical factors influencing maize availability.
                                                - provide actionable insights for stakeholders to enhance food security management. 

The code is divided into modular steps according to the coursework brief and rubric.

Explanation of SimpleImputer:
SimpleImputer is a class in the sklearn.impute module of the Scikit-Learn library in Python. 
It provides basic strategies for imputing missing values. 
The imputation strategies used is "mean", which replaces the missing values using the mean along each column.
In order to, use an annual average to fill missing data the above program calculates the average value for each column 
within each year and using these averages to fill the missing values. 
This method maintains the seasonal trends and yearly variations, making it more suitable for time-series data.

"""
Visualisations Purposes and Interpretations Explained:

1. Histograms
Purpose: Histograms are used to visualise the distribution of numerical data within the dataset.

Interpretation:

Shape: Look at the shape of the histogram (e.g., normal distribution, skewed distribution). This helps in understanding the central tendency and spread of the data.
Peaks: Identify the peaks (modes) in the histogram. Peaks indicate the most frequent values within the dataset.
Spread: The width of the histogram bins can show the variability in the data. A wider spread suggests more variability.
Outliers: Notice any bars that are isolated from the rest of the data. These can indicate potential outliers.


2. Scatter Plots
Purpose: Scatter plots show the relationship between two numerical variables.

Interpretation:

Pattern: Look for any visible pattern or trend in the scatter plot (e.g., linear, exponential).
Correlation: Determine if there is a positive or negative correlation between the two variables. A positive correlation means that as 
one variable increases, the other also increases. A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases.
Clusters: Identify any clusters or groupings of points which can indicate subgroups within the data.
Outliers: Points that are far from the rest can be outliers, which might require further investigation.


3. Line Charts
Purpose: Line charts are used to display data points over a continuous time interval, showing trends over time.

Interpretation:

Trends: Observe the overall direction of the line (upward, downward, or constant) to identify trends over time.
Fluctuations: Look for fluctuations or volatility in the data. Sharp changes can indicate events or periods of instability.
Seasonality: Identify any recurring patterns at regular intervals which can indicate seasonal effects.
Comparisons: If multiple lines are plotted, compare them to see how different variables or categories change over time.


4. Linear Trendline
Purpose: A linear trendline helps to visualise the general direction of the relationship between two variables, typically using a least
squares regression line.

Interpretation:

Slope: The slope of the trendline indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between the variables. A positive slope
indicates a positive relationship, while a negative slope indicates a negative relationship.
Fit: Assess how well the trendline fits the data points. A good fit indicates that the linear model is appropriate for the data.
Residuals: Points that are far from the trendline are residuals and indicate the degree of deviation from the linear relationship.

Feature Selection and Model Building Elements Purposes and Interpretations Explained:

Feature Selection
Purpose: Identify the relevant columns (features) for model building.

Trade Balance Calculation
Trade Balance = Total Exports - Total Imports.
Purpose: Calculate the trade balance, which is the difference between total exports and total imports and adds a new column 
Trade Balance to the dataset.

Visualising Trade Balance Over Time
Purpose: Show how the trade balance changes over time.

Line Chart
X-Axis: Date or time index.
Y-Axis: Trade Balance.
Interpretation: Observe trends and fluctuations in the trade balance over time. Look for patterns, seasonal effects, or anomalies.
Histogram of Trade Balance
Purpose: Visualise the distribution of the trade balance values.

Histogram
X-Axis: Trade Balance values.
Y-Axis: Frequency or count of occurrences.
KDE (Kernel Density Estimate): A smoothed line representing the distribution's probability density function.
Interpretation/Purpose: Understand the central tendency, spread, and skewness of the trade balance distribution. 
                Identify common values and potential outliers.

Preparing Data for Regression
Purpose: Prepare the features (X) and target (y) for building the regression model.
Features (X): Combination of export and import columns.
Target (y): Trade Balance.
Imputation: Handle remaining missing values by filling them with the mean of the respective column.
Splitting Data into Training and Testing Sets
Purpose: Split the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate the model's performance.

Training Set: Used to train the model
Testing Set: Used to test and evaluate the model.
Test Size: 20% of the data is used for testing, and the rest is for training.
Creating and Training the Model
Purpose: Build and train a linear regression model.

Model: Linear Regression
Training: Fit the model to the training data.

Making Predictions
Purpose: Use the trained model to make predictions on the test data.
Predictions: Calculate predicted values of the trade balance for the test set.
Evaluating the Model
Purpose: Assess the performance of the regression model.

Mean Squared Error (MSE): Measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values.
Interpretation: Lower MSE indicates better model performance.
Plotting Actual vs. Predicted Values
Purpose: Illustrate the relationship between actual and predicted trade balance values.

Scatter Plot
X-Axis: Actual Trade Balance.
Y-Axis: Predicted Trade Balance.
Interpretation: Points close to the diagonal line (where actual equals predicted) indicate good predictions. 
                Deviations from the line highlight prediction errors.

Feature Engineering Elements Purposes and Interpretations Explained:

Polynomial Features
Purpose: By adding polynomial features, the model can capture more complex relationships between the features and the target variable, 
potentially improving the model's performance.

Model Performance
Purpose: Evaluate the improvement in model performance by comparing the MSE and RMSE before and after adding polynomial features.

Scatter Plot Visualisation
(Compares actual trade balance values against predicted values from the polynomial regression model.)
Purpose: The scatter plot helps in visually assessing how well the polynomial regression model predicts the trade 
balance. This aids in enhancing the model's capacity to better fit the data by accounting for non-linear relationships, ultimately 
leading to more accurate predictions.
Interpretation: Points closer to the diagonal line (where actual equals predicted) indicate better model performance. Deviations from this line highlight prediction errors.

Explanation of the Above Code:

Short Description of the Code Base
This additonal code base implements feature engineering, analysis, and visualisations to predict potential food shortages and understand 
price volatility in the maize supply chain. 
The implemented analysis and visualisations address the primary objectives of predicting potential food shortages and understanding price 
volatility in the maize supply chain. By calculating total supply and demand, visualizing their trends and distributions, analysing trade 
balance volatility, and building a predictive model, this approach provides comprehensive insights into the supply chain dynamics. 
This fulfills the objectives of ensuring food security by identifying potential shortages and stabilizing prices through informed 
decision-making.

Overall, this additional work complements the initial analysis by offering a more effective approach to understanding and predicting maize 
supply chain behavior, with the dataset, despite previous errors encountered.

The objectives are fulfilled through the following steps:

1. Calculation of Supply and Demand
The total supply and demand of maize are calculated by summing the respective import and export quantities.


2. Visualisations of Supply and Demand Over Time
Line plots are used to visualise the trends in total supply and demand over time

Purpose: To visualise the trends in total supply and demand over time using line plots.

Interpretation: These plots help identify periods of surplus or shortage and provide insights into seasonal patterns or anomalies in the 
data.
High Points on the Line: Indicate periods where supply or demand is high.
Low Points on the Line: Indicate periods where supply or demand is low.
Crossing of Lines: When supply and demand lines cross, it indicates a shift from surplus to deficit or vice versa.


3. Histogram of Supply and Demand
Histograms are generated to show the distribution of supply and demand quantities.

Purpose: To examine the distribution of total supply and demand quantities.

Interpretation: Histograms with kernel density estimates (KDE) reveal the distribution shape and central tendencies, highlighting typical 
supply and demand levels.
High Bars: Indicate a higher frequency of certain supply or demand quantities.
Low Bars: Indicate a lower frequency of certain supply or demand quantities.
Peak of the KDE Curve: Shows the most common quantity for supply or demand.
Spread of the KDE Curve: Indicates the variability in supply or demand quantities.


4. Price Volatility Analysis
The trade balance change and its volatility are calculated and plotted to understand fluctuations over time

Purpose: To calculate and visualise the volatility in the trade balance over time.

Interpretation: 
The trade balance volatility plot indicates periods of high and low stability in the trade balance, which can reflect 
market conditions and potential price volatility.
High Points on the Line: Indicate periods of high volatility in the trade balance.
Low Points on the Line: Indicate periods of stability in the trade balance.
Trend of the Line: An upward trend indicates increasing volatility, while a downward trend indicates decreasing volatility.


5. Regression Model for Predicting Potential Food Shortages
A linear regression model is built to predict trade balance using total supply and demand as predictors.
The model's performance is evaluated and visualised by comparing actual vs. predicted trade balances.
This additional work enhances the initial analysis by providing a clearer understanding of supply-demand dynamics and price volatility, 
ultimately aiding in predicting potential food shortages.

Purpose: To build and evaluate a linear regression model for predicting the trade balance based on total supply and demand.

Interpretation: 
The model's performance, evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), indicates how well the supply and demand data predict 
the trade balance. The scatter plot of actual vs. predicted values visualizes the model's accuracy and potential areas for improvement.
Scatter Plot Points: Each point represents an actual vs. predicted trade balance value pair.
Points Close to the Diagonal Line: Indicate accurate predictions.
Points Far from the Diagonal Line: Indicate less accurate predictions.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): A lower MSE value indicates a better fit of the model to the data.
